# React Password Generator

## Overview

This project is a password generator built using React. It's designed to help you understand and practice React Hooks, including `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`. The application allows users to generate a random password with customizable options, including the length of the password and whether to include numbers and special characters. It also features a copy button to easily copy the generated password to the clipboard.
